# CLAUDE.md Revision Summary

## Major Changes Made:

### 1. **Removed Redundant Sections**
- "Important Configuration" section - duplicated info from "User Context"
- Multiple repetitive tmux examples and explanations
- Redundant monitoring instructions that were repeated for each platform
- "Technical Details" section with duplicated information
- "First Successful Test Milestone" - too specific for general config

### 2. **Consolidated Related Content**
- **Command Execution**: Combined 3 separate sections about tmux into one coherent section
- **Git Operations**: Merged scattered git-related instructions into one section
- **Monitoring Requirements**: Consolidated all monitoring instructions instead of repeating for each platform
- **Interaction Guidelines**: Numbered and organized scattered guidelines

### 3. **Restructured for Clarity**
- Clear hierarchy: System → Guidelines → Execution → Git → TDD → Safety
- Removed multiple "CRITICAL" labels (everything can't be critical)
- Integrated examples where they're relevant instead of separate section
- Simplified platform-specific guidelines to only unique information

### 4. **Reduced Repetition**
- Tmux instructions were explained 3+ times - now just once
- Monitoring requirements were repeated for each platform - now general + specific
- Skip-permissions mode was mentioned multiple times - now consolidated
- "Fully automated" concept was repeated extensively - now stated clearly once

### 5. **Improved Readability**
- Shorter, more focused sections
- Clear numbered lists for guidelines
- Quick reference for tmux commands
- Removed verbose explanations where simple instructions suffice

## Document Structure (Old vs New):

**Old**: ~400 lines with lots of repetition
**New**: ~250 lines with clear organization

The revised version maintains all critical information while being much more concise and easier to follow.
